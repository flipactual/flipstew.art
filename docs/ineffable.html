  <p>Ineffable is a simulation engine for one-of-a-kind, interactive narrative experiences in living worlds that grow along with the reader/player</p>
  <p>It's also whatever proof-of-concept game I create along with it</p>
  <p>The guiding concept is to give you more options each turn than any other game, and if it’s an option for you, it’s an option for non-player characters as well</p>
  <p>It exists in pieces which you may never see in their entirety. Something tangible may come of it someday, who's to say</p>

  <h2>Non-Player Characters</h2>
  <p>Non-player characters are powered by an AI which is essentially a dynamic forward chaining rules engine on top of a pile of primitive neural nets in front of a relational database</p>

  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <p>Actions have categories which have no impact on gameplay or simulation but make interfaces cleaner</p>
  <p>Actions have:
    <ol>
      <li>Possibility checks</li>
      <li>Probability checks</li>
      <li>Effects</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>Actions and Time and Turns</h3>
  <p>Actions take a certain amount of action points</p>
  <p>A turn has an allocated number of action slots</p>
  <p>Each action slot has an allocated number of action points</p>

  <h3>Factors</h3>
  <p>Various factors influence possibility and probability for actions</p>

  <h4>Values</h4>
  <h4>Physical Health</h4>
  <h4>Mental Health</h4>
  <h4>Emotions</h4>

  <h4>Personality Traits</h4>
  <h4>Archetypes & Personality Traits</h4>
  <figure class="left">
    <table align="left"><tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <a href="media/archetypes.png">
            <img
              src="media/archetypes-thumb.png"

          <figcaption>Example Archetypes</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
  </figure>
  <p>Personality traits are spectrums and -1 to 1 values</p>
  <p>Characters have personality traits which change over time. An archetype can be determined based on a character's current traits for ease of communication</p>

  <h4 id="relationships">Relationships</h4>
  <p>Relationships have types and 0 to 1 values</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Peer</li>
    <li>Neighbor</li>
    <li>Friend</li>
    <li>Family</li>
    <li>Rival</li>
    <li>Enemy</li>
    <li>Mentor</li>
    <li>Apprentice</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="skills">Skills</h4>
  <p>Some actions are associated directly with skills which, partially, determine their outcomes</p>
  <p>For example, any character with some flour, water, and a source of heat can attempt to make bread, but it might not go so well the first time</p>
  <p>Skills range from 0 to 1</p>

  <h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>
  <p>Achievements have no impact on gameplay or simulation but ease goal tracking for players</p>
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>I've wanted something like Ineffable since before I hit double digits, so I've had the benefit of being inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook">Dynabook</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age">A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)">Harvest Moon</a>, and so many other efforts</p>
  <p>It's worth noting that I've also contributed to projects with similar construction, including <a href="https://github.com/incrediblesound/story-graph">story-graph</a></p>
