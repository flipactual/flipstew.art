  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>Ineffable is a simulation engine for one-of-a-kind, interactive narrative experiences in living worlds that grow along with the reader/player</p>
  <p>The guiding concept is to give you more options each turn than any other game, and if it’s an option for you, it’s an option for non-player characters as well</p>
  <p>It exists in pieces which you may never see in their entirety. Something tangible may come of it someday, who's to say</p>
  <h2>Non-Player Characters</h2>
  <p>Non-player characters are powered by an AI which is essentially a dynamic forward chaining rules engine on top of a pile of primitive neural nets in front of a relational database</p>
  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <p>Actions have:
    <ol>
      <li>Possibility checks</li>
      <li>Probability checks</li>
      <li>Effects</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>Actions and Time and Turns</h3>
  <p>Actions take a certain amount of action points</p>
  <p>A turn has an allocated number of action slots</p>
  <p>Each action slot has an allocated number of action points</p>

  <h3>Factors</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Values</li>
    <li>Physical Health</li>
    <li>Mental Health</li>
    <li>Emotions</li>
    <li>Relationships</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>I've wanted something like Ineffable since before I hit double digits, so I've had the benefit of being inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook">Dynabook</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age">A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)">Harvest Moon</a>, and countless other efforts</p>
  <p>It's worth noting that I've also contributed to projects with similar construction, including <a href="https://github.com/incrediblesound/story-graph">story-graph</a></p>
