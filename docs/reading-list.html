    <dd><p>I don't enjoy fantasy, and I don't understand what I've just read really, but it's absolutely immaculately written, and I'm for sure going to read the next two</p></dd>

    <dt><em id="The Ministry for the Future">The Ministry for the Future</em> by Kim Stanley Robinson</dt>
    <dd><p>Ambling and poorly constructed, can't recommend for anyone who needs or wants a coherent narrative, but it scratches the surface of a few crucial issues</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="The Adventures of Pinocchio">The Adventures of Pinocchio</em> by Carlo Collodi</dt>
    <dd><p>Fun read. Great footnotes. Baffling story</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="The Diamond Age">The Diamond Age</em> by Neal Stephenson</dt>
    <dd><p>The story itself is a bit much for me, but I love the ideas of technology repurposed to help actual people instead of corporations. Gets my mind going on Dynabook things</p></dd>

    <dt><em id="A Poetry Handbook">A Poetry Handbook</em> by Mary Oliver</dt>
    <dd><p>Somehow edifying despite itself. Better to pull terms from than actually read or take as substantive advice</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="A Desolation Called Peace">A Desolation Called Peace</em> by Arkady Martine</dt>
    <dd><p>A vast and curious universe, like Foundation but actually manageable, in so few words</p><p>Sparked an interest in metered poetry for me</p></dd>

    <dt><em id="The Galaxy, and the Ground Within">The Galaxy, and the Ground Within</em> by Becky Chambers</dt>
    <dd><p>I'd recommend this series easily, but I did wish it provided a view of larger conflict or any real risk of danger... felt a bit too easy</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Made my brain a little mushy. Loved it</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="Planet of Exile">Planet of Exile</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin</dt>
    <dd><p>Took me a minute to get into, but it was a good read. I particularly enjoyed how it built on Rocannon's World</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="Rocannon‚Äôs World">Rocannon‚Äôs World</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin</dt>
    <dd><p>Fun. Wish more of the themes (like invincibility layers) had carried into the other Hainish Chronicles</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="Dawn">Dawn</em> by Octavia E. Butler</dt>
    <dd><p>This is my third or fourth book by Butler and honestly she's just too perverted for me</p></dd>

    <dt><em id="A Psalm for the Wild-Built">A Psalm for the Wild-Built</em> by Becky Chambers</dt>
    <dd><p>I felt that this little book ambled about, but ultimately it was a vibe</p><p>I enjoyed the significance placed on ceremony and counseling in a solarpunk setting</dd>    <dt><em id="Ishmael">My Ishmael</em> by Daniel Quinn</dt>
    <dd><p>Attempting to note any thoughts on Daniel Quinn's books makes me want to re-read them all. I think perhaps that's my greatest takeaway ‚Äî these books contain bold questions that Quinn cannot always answer but leaves as an exercise for the reader to carry with them each day</p><p><em>Beyond Civilization</em> seems like an attempt a field guide, but perhaps it's not quite there</p><p>A tremendous body of work for anyone who understands that the way they live is wrong</p></dd>

    <dt><em id="Dust">Dust</em> by Hugh Howie</dt>
    <dd><p>This was probably my third read of <em id="Wool</em>, <em>Shift</em>, and <em>Dust">Wool</em>, <em>Shift</em>, and <em>Dust</em>. I enjoy the series. It's transportive for me, and I can get lost in its sad world... perhaps part of the appeal is that I can hold the entire world of the narrative in my head?</p><p>As far as post-apocalyptic fiction goes, I think this series is refreshing and thought-provoking</p></dd>

    <dt><em id="We">We</em> by Yevgeny Zamyatin</dt>
    <dd><p>I highly recommend <em>We</em> as an alternative to <em>1984</em> or <em>Brave New World</em> for any reader new to dystopian fiction</p></dd>

    <dd><p>This was a very quick read that I found valuable for strategies on being effective. recurring thought while reading was "this should be advice for everyone... workers are much more capable of applying this than managers"</p></dd>
