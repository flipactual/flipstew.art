  <h3>January</h3>

    <dt><em id="The CEO Test">The CEO Test</em> by Adam Bryant and Kevin Sharer</dt>
    <dd><p>This was a very quick read that I found valuable for strategies on being effective. My recurring thought while reading was "this should be advice for everyone... workers are much more capable of applying this than managers"</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="Wool">Wool</em> by Hugh Howie</dt>
    <dd><p>See <a href="#Dust"><em>Dust</em></a></p></dd>
    <dt><em id="We">We</em> by Yevgeny Zamyatin</dt>
    <dd><p>I highly recommend <em>We</em> as an alternative to <em>1984</em> or <em>Brave New World</em> for any reader new to dystopian fiction</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="Ishmael">Ishmael</em> by Daniel Quinn</dt>
    <dd><p>See <a href="#My Ishmael"><em>My Ishmael</em></a></p></dd>
    <dt><em id="A Psalm for the Wild-Built">A Psalm for the Wild-Built</em> by Becky Chambers</dt>
    <dd><p>I felt that this little book ambled about, but ultimately it was a vibe</p><p>I enjoyed the significance placed on ceremony and counseling in a solarpunk setting</dd>
    <dt><em id="Shift">Shift</em> by Hugh Howie</dt>
    <dd><p>See <a href="#Dust"><em>Dust</em></a></p></dd>
    <dt><em id="Dust">Dust</em> by Hugh Howie</dt>
    <dd><p>This was probably my third read of <em id="Wool</em>, <em>Shift</em>, and <em>Dust">Wool</em>, <em>Shift</em>, and <em>Dust</em>. I enjoy the series. It's transportive for me, and I can get lost in its sad world... perhaps part of the appeal is that I can hold the entire world of the narrative in my head?</p><p>As far as post-apocalyptic fiction goes, I think this series is refreshing and thought-provoking</p></dd>
    <dt><em id="The Story of B">The Story of B</em> by Daniel Quinn</dt>
    <dd><p>See <a href="#My Ishmael"><em>My Ishmael</em></a></p></dd>
    <dt><em id="Beyond Civilization">Beyond Civilization</em> by Daniel Quinn</dt>
    <dd><p>See <a href="#My Ishmael"><em>My Ishmael</em></a></p></dd>
    <dt><em id="My Ishmael">My Ishmael</em> by Daniel Quinn</dt>
    <dd><p>Attempting to note any thoughts on Daniel Quinn's books makes me want to re-read them all. I think perhaps that's my greatest takeaway — these books contain bold questions that Quinn cannot always answer but leaves as an exercise for the reader to carry with them each day</p><p><em>Beyond Civilization</em> seems like an attempt a field guide, but perhaps it's not quite there</p><p>A tremendous body of work for anyone who understands that the way they live is wrong</p></dd>
